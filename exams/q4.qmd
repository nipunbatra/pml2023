1. Consider the figure above, where we fit the model $p(y=1 \mid \mathbf{x}, \bm{{\theta}})=\sigma\left(\theta_0+\theta_1 x_1+\theta_2 x_2\right)$ by maximum likelihood, i.e., we minimize $J_a({\theta})=-\ell\left(\bm{{\theta}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text {train }}\right)$
where $\ell\left(\bm{{\theta}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text {train }}\right)$ is the log likelihood on the training set. In the questions below, **when multiple decision boundaries are possible, you should choose the one which minimizes the number of classification errors on the training dataset.**
    - (a) Sketch a decision boundary for the model. How many classification errors does your method make? (1 mark)
    - (b) Now, we regularize **only** the $\theta_0$ parameter, i.e., we minimize: $J_b({\theta})=-\ell\left(\bm{{\theta}}, \mathcal{D}_{\text {train }}\right)+\lambda \theta_0^2$. Suppose $\lambda$ is a very large number, so we regularize $\theta_0$ all the way to 0, but all other parameters are unregularized. Sketch a possible decision boundary. How many classification errors does your method make? (1 mark)
    - (c) Repeat part (b), but we now instead regularize the $\theta_1$ parameter. (1 mark)
    - (d) Repeat part (b), but we now instead regularize the $\theta_2$ parameter. (1 mark)

2. Prove that softmax is equivalent to sigmoid when there are only two classes. (1 mark)

3. $y = \sigma(z)$, where $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. We also know that $z = f(a)$. Find $\dfrac{\partial y}{\partial a}$.  (1 mark)

4. Let us consider a $K$-class logistic regression problem. For some example, $x$, we get our outputs before the application of softmax as: $z_1=x^T\theta_1$, $\cdots , z_k=x^T\theta_k$, $\cdots ,z_K=x^T\theta_K$. We denote the vector of outputs as 
$\vec{z} = \left[\begin{array}{@{}c@{}}
    z_{1} \\
    z_{2} \\
    \vdots \\
    z_{K} 
    \end{array} \right]$

We will try to now use the cross entropy loss function to train our model. One of the terms in the cross entropy loss function is: $\log\left(\frac{e^{z_k}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}\right)$ which we refer to as $\mathrm{LOGSOFTMAX}(z_k, \vec{z})$.
However, we find that $\mathrm{LOGSOFTMAX}(z_k, \vec{z})$ cannot be computed directly for several cases. When $z_k$ is a large number (e.g. 5000), a computer is unable to compute $e^{z_k}$ as an overflow occurs ($e^{z_k}$ = inf). When $z_k$ is a large negative number (e.g. -5000), $e^{z_k}$ = 0.0.

- (a) What problem occurs in computing $\mathrm{LOGSOFTMAX}(z_k, \vec{z})$ when all elements of $\vec{z}$ are large (in magnitude) negative numbers (e.g. all $z_i < -6000$)? (1 mark)

- (b) Modify the $\mathrm{LOGSOFTMAX}(z_k, \vec{z})$ expression using some **trick** so that we are able to compute it for any $z_k$ and $\vec{z}$. You need to show the steps/simplifications you make. Show that this trick solves both the above problems (overflow and the problem you find in part (a) of this question) (2 marks)


5. We use a new type of coin for coin toss experiments. For this coin, the probability of heads goes down exponentially with the draw. Assuming the probaility of heads for the first draw ($i=1$) is $\theta$ and for the $i$th draw is $\theta_i = \dfrac{\theta}{2^{i-1}}$. What is the maximum likelihood estimate for $\theta$ for obtaining the draws as: T, H, H. Assume that each draw is independent of the others. Ofcourse, the identical assumption can not be made.
